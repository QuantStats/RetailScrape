# RetailScrape

The file `shopee_selenium.py` demonstrates a simple web scraping example from a retail section of Shopee (an ecommerce website) using **Selenium**. My code scrapes from the watch section of Shopee, then saves each page data (e.g. product names, prices, etc) into a *json* file. Up to 6 pages of data are scraped in my example, and the number of pages can be increased or decreased if necessary.

To read the *json* files, one may use a browser that has *json* reading capability or use an online *json* reader. See [this](https://github.com/QuantStats/RetailScrape/blob/master/images/page0_view.PNG) for a viewing example in Firefox.
