# RetailScrape

The file `shopee_selenium.py` demonstrates a simple web scraping example from a retail section of Shopee (an ecommerce website) using **Selenium**. My code scraped from the watch section of Shopee, then saved each page data (e.g. product names, links, prices, etc) into a *json* file. Up to 6 pages of data are scraped in my example, and the number of pages can be increased or decreased if necessary.

To read the *json* files, one may use a browser that has *json* reading capability or use an online *json* reader.
